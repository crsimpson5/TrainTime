# TrainTime

This app loads train scheduling info from a database and calculates the next train arrival. The user may add a new train using the form or remove a train using the train icon on the table. When a train is added or removed on the page it will also be added or removed on the database.

A new train will only be added if all the input fields are filled and the frequency is a number.
